# Group Project Abstract
### Binary code Obfuscation / Anti-Reverse Engineering
#####  &emsp;By Garrett Donovon & Sinclair DeYoung

Our project will be on binary code obfuscation & anti-reverse enginering. "Binary code obfuscation primarly allows your project to be shadowed to unmanned, automated tools.This process should have any scans of your tool for binary pattern search will end with nothing found. If something were to simulate your tool with some VM (Virutal Machine), he will be able to end your application without error, and memory inspection can lead to the detection of the unencrypted code."[^fn1] "Anit-reverse engineering is a security measure that prevents unauthorized attempts to covert app binaries back to their sourse code, safeguarding an application from an attack. This involves analyzing the source code to detect and prevent attacks aginst an applications design and detect security flaws like sensitive data exposure such as API, URLs, or private keys."[^fn2] The purpose of this project is to understand how to implement and utilize proper safeguarding techneques in program pretection. The primary tool that will be used is **tigress** which is a C obfuscator for Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, WASM platforms. his tool can be used to "learn how code obfuscation algorithms work, or generate arbitrarily complex reverse engineering challege problems for yourself."[^fn3]
